"""Skill health checking — acceptance tests.

Acceptance criteria:
1. check_all_skills_health outputs health status for all skills
2. YAML-malformed skill is marked FAIL with specific error reason
3. Script file referenced in SKILL.md body but missing on disk is flagged
4. Broken symbolic links in scripts/ are detected
5. All healthy -> exit code 0; any failure -> exit code 1
6. --json flag produces machine-readable JSON output
7. Pre-release version strings are accepted as valid
